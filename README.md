# PX4-Modification-Example-Files

This repository provides **example PX4 source code modifications** to complement the [UAV-Toolbox-Setup-Guide](https://github.com/gurt1223/UAV-Toolbox-Setup-Guide) and [BRAT Framework](https://github.com/gurt1223/brat).  
These examples enable features such as **custom uORB topic logging**, **user-defined parameters**, **custom telemetry streams**, and **firmware memory reduction** for PX4-based flight controllers.

  Example files for creating and integrating new uORB topics into the PX4 logging system.

- **Parameters/**  
  Example files showing how to define and integrate custom PX4 parameters.

- **Telemetry/**  
  Example MAVLink stream modifications for adding a custom telemetry channel.

- **Flash Memory/cubeorange/**  
  Firmware and configuration adjustments to reduce flash usage on the CubeOrange autopilot.

## How to Use
1. Follow the setup steps in the [UAV-Toolbox-Setup-Guide](https://github.com/gurt1223/UAV-Toolbox-Setup-Guide).  
2. Choose which modifications you want to apply (e.g., parameters, telemetry, or logging).  
3. Copy the example files into the corresponding PX4 source directories.  
4. Rebuild the PX4 firmware and upload it to your flight controller.  
5. Use alongside the [BRAT Framework](https://github.com/gurt1223/brat) for algorithm testing and logging in MATLAB/Simulink.
